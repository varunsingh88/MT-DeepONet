# Synergistic Learning with Multi-Task DeepONet for Efficient PDE Problem Solving  

This repository contains the source code and resources associated with the manuscript:  
[*Synergistic Learning with Multi-Task DeepONet for Efficient PDE Problem Solving*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02198).  

## Overview  
The repository demonstrates the implementation of Multi-Task DeepONet for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) efficiently through synergistic learning. The codebase is divided into three segments based on the problem discussed in the manuscript.

## Installation  

### Prerequisites
